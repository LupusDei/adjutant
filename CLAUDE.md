# Mayor Context (gastown_boy)

> **Recovery**: Run `gt prime` after compaction, clear, or new session

Full context is injected by `gt prime` at session start.

## CRITICAL: Scope Understanding

**Gastown-Boy is the DASHBOARD for ALL of Gas Town**, not just a UI for itself.

- **Beads**: Show from `~/gt/.beads/` (town beads, hq-* prefix), NOT gastown_boy/.beads/
- **Agents**: Show ALL rigs, polecats, crew across the entire town
- **Mail**: Mayor's inbox at town level
- **Convoys**: All town convoys

The UI runs from `~/gt` and displays the complete state of Gas Town.
See `.claude/rules/00-critical-scope.md` for details.
